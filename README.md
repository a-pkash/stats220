# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in science and commerce (majoring in statistics, logic and computation, and information systems).
- I am taking STATS 220 because I have interest in working in data and would like to get a better understanding of the systems and processes used in the industry.
- I am interested in learning about how data can be manipulated in R.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
