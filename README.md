# stats220

This is *my* repo for **STATS 220**. 

## A little about me:

* I am undertaking a degree in science and commerce (majoring in statistics, logic and computation, and information systems).
* I am taking STATS 220 because I have interest in working in data and would like to get a better understanding of the systems and processes used in the industry.
* I am interested in learning about how data can be manipulated in R.

## My top 3 ice cream flavours:

1. Cookie dough (with chunks only)
2. Chocolate brownie
3. Peanut Butter
